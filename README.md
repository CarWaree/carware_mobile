#  CarWare

CarWare is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** mobile application designed to help users manage their vehicles, track maintenance activities, and connect with maintenance service providers.  
The project uses **Compose Multiplatform** to share UI and business logic across platforms while maintaining a clean and scalable architecture.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Provide a centralized platform for vehicle and maintenance management
- Reduce maintenance tracking overhead for vehicle owners
- Demonstrate modern mobile development using Kotlin Multiplatform
- Apply clean architecture and best practices in a real-world project

---

## ✨ Core Features

- Vehicle management (add, update, view vehicle details)
- Maintenance tracking and history
- Authentication and secure user sessions
- Token-based API communication
- Shared navigation and UI logic across platforms
- Scalable and maintainable architecture

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

CarWare follows **MVVM** combined with the **Repository Pattern**, ensuring separation of concerns and testability.

```
Compose UI
   ↓
ViewModel
   ↓
Repository
   ↓
Remote Data Source (Ktor Client)
```

### Key Principles
- Single source of truth for data
- Platform-independent business logic
- Clear boundaries between UI, domain, and data layers

---

## 🧠 State Management

- ViewModels manage UI state
- Kotlin Coroutines handle asynchronous operations
- State is exposed to Compose using immutable state models

---

## 🌐 Networking & API Handling

- API communication is handled using **Ktor Client**
- JSON serialization via **kotlinx.serialization**
- Authentication tokens are:
  - Retrieved on login/signup
  - Stored securely
  - Automatically attached to authorized requests
- Centralized error handling for unauthorized responses

---

## 🧭 Navigation Logic

- Shared Compose navigation system
- Start destination is determined dynamically based on:
  - Onboarding completion
  - Authentication status
  - Vehicle availability

This ensures a smooth and context-aware user flow.
